## Database Schema

The application uses IndexedDB via Dexie to store workout configurations:

```typescript
type Workout = {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  workTime: string; // Format: "MM:SS"
  restTime: string; // Format: "MM:SS"
  exercises: number; // Number of exercises per set
  sets: number; // Number of sets
  breakTime: string; // Format: "MM:SS" - break between sets
};
```

## Timer States

The workout timer uses XState for predictable state management:

- **idle** - Initial state, waiting to start
- **work** - Active exercise period
- **rest** - Rest period between exercises
- **break** - Break period between sets
- **done** - Workout completed

Each state supports pause/resume functionality.

## Audio System

The app includes audio cues for:

- Second countdown (3-2 seconds remaining)
- Last second warning (1 second remaining)
- Completion sound (when timer reaches 0)

Audio is initialized on first user interaction to comply with browser policies.
